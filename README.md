Machine Learning Project IDEA

This project makes use of different machine learning algorithms to make binary classification on financial data and predict a stock is worth buying or not.
From a trading perspective:

- the 1 identifies those stocks that a hypothetical trader should buy at the start of the year and sell at the end of the year for a profit
  
- the 0 identifies those stocks that a hypothetical trader should not buy since their value will decrease, meaning a loss of capital.
  
Data repository:

- 5 Datasets (2014-2018), each with 200+ Financial Indicators of US stocks.
  
- The last column of datasets is ‘class’, lists a binary classification for each stock.

Learning pipeline:

- Data Preprocessing
  
- Model Tuning
  
- Train the models
  
- Evaluate the trained models
