Machine Learning Project IDEA

The type of project I would plan to execute is the second one (focus on data). The idea is to answer a fairly complicated question for investors, namely, whether the price of a stock will rise or fall. The purpose of the project is to try to predict whether the closing price of a stock will rise or fall below the closing price of the previous trading day. The problem belongs to a classification problem. I am still undecided about the methods to be used, the ones I thought of are logistic regression, SVM and also another one that was not seen in class the decision tree. Regarding the data, I could download them for free from yahoo finance, which seem quite realistic to me.
